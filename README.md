Personal interests

🎮 From time to time I like to play video games.

📷 Squash, bambinton, swimming pool or just a walk in the park - all for it.

📚 Stephen King or Terry Pratchett are a great way to spend time.


Rest

😄 I prefer to be addressed as “you”, I don’t like formalities.

⚡ Interesting fact: my cat's name is Lola
